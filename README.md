# IN PROGRESS
# QuickBooks ([docs](https://dbt-quickbooks.netlify.app/))

This package models quickbooks data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/quickbooks). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/quickbooks-suiteanalytics#schemainformation).

The main focus of this package is to enable users to insights into their quickbooks data that can be used for financial statement reporting and deeper analysis.

## Models
This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously with our [quickbooks source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_quickbooks_source). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below. Intermediate models are used to create these output models.

| **model**                | **description**                                                                                                                                |
